;	Create an Assembly program that:
;		- Reads two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user.
;		- Performs the calculation.
;		- Prints the result to the screen.
;	This challenge shows that you can:
;		- Handle user input and conditional branching
;		- Perform arithmetic operations using registers
;		- Combine multiple concepts: I/O, math, and decision-making
;		- Build a small, interactive program entirely in ASM
